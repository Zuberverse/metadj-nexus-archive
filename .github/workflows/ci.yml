# Continuous Integration Workflow
#
# Runs quality checks, tests, and build verification on all branches.
# Uses caching for faster subsequent runs.
#
# Jobs:
# - quality: Lint, type-check, unit tests, build
# - e2e: Playwright E2E smoke tests (runs after quality)
#
# Note: We don't use .github/workflows/setup.yml reusable workflow here because
# GitHub Actions jobs run in isolation. Each job needs its own checkout and
# npm install, and the reusable workflow doesn't share node_modules between jobs.
# The current approach with npm cache is more efficient for this use case.
