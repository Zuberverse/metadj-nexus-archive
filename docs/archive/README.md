# Documentation Archive

**Last Modified**: 2026-01-26 13:00 EST

This archive is intentionally minimal. One‑off roadmaps, audits, and status logs live in Git history and the project `../../CHANGELOG.md`, not here.

## What Belongs Here

Only keep docs that remain useful as long‑term reference but are not actively maintained (e.g., a major migration rationale that still informs future work). Use date‑prefixed filenames for new additions.

If a document is a point‑in‑time report or a completed workflow log, delete it after its insights are captured in active docs or the changelog.

For current documentation, start at `../README.md`.
