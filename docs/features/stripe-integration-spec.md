# Stripe Integration (Deferred)

> Placeholder for future billing work in MetaDJ Nexus.

**Last Modified**: 2026-01-13 14:10 EST

## Status

Stripe integration is deferred. MetaDJ Nexus currently runs with authenticated access but without paid tiers. When billing work resumes, start here and reference the archived spec at `docs/archive/2025-12-19-stripe-integration-spec.md`.

## Scope (Future)

- Billing foundations (account provisioning, secure checkout, entitlement hooks)
- Event tracking alignment with analytics
- Clear access messaging in UI
